Abstract = {{A method for calculating Sobolev smoothed Fourier continuations is
   presented. The method is based on the recently introduced singular value
   decomposition based Fourier continuation approach. This approach allows
   for highly accurate Fourier series approximations of non-periodic
   functions. These super-algebraically convergent approximations can be
   highly oscillatory in an extended region, contaminating the Fourier
   coefficients. It is shown that through solving a subsequent least
   squares problem, a Fourier continuation can be produced which has been
   dramatically smoothed in that the Fourier coefficients exhibit a
   prescribed rate of decay as the wave number increases. While the
   smoothing procedure has no significant negative effect on the accuracy
   of the Fourier series approximation, in some situations the smoothed
   continuations can actually yield increased accuracy in the approximation
   of the function and its derivatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The nonequispaced Fourier transform arises in a variety of application
   area:, from medical imaging to radio astronomy to the numerical
   solution of partial differential equations. In a typical problem, one
   is given an irregular sampling of N data in the frequency domain and
   one is interested in reconstructing the corresponding function in the
   physical domain. When the sampling is uniform, the fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) allows this calculation to be computed in O(N log N)
   operations rather than O(N-2) operations. Unfortunately, when the
   sampling is nonuniform, the FFT does not apply. Over the last few
   years, a number of algorithms have been developed to overcome this
   limitation and are often referred to as nonuniform FFTs (NUFFTs). These
   rely on a mixture of interpolation and the judicious use of the FFT on
   an oversampled grid (A. Dutt and V. Rokhlin, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 14
   (1993), pp. 1368-1383).
   In this paper, we observe that one of the standard interpolation or
   ``gridding{''} schemes, based on Gaussians, can be accelerated by a
   significant factor without precomputation and storage of the
   interpolation weights. This is of particular value in two- and
   three-dimensional settings, saving either 10(d)N in storage in d
   dimensions or a factor of about 5-10 in CPU time (independent of
   dimension).}},

Abstract = {{The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used widely in signal processing
   for efficient computation of the FT of finite-length signals over a set
   of uniformly spaced frequency locations. However, in many applications,
   one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a
   nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for
   the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper
   presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal
   in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error
   over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes
   to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max
   approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than
   conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also
   useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as
   the Kaiser-Bessel function.}},

Abstract = {{The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) can be computed with a
   fast algorithm, referred to as the nonuniform fast Fourier transform
   (NFFT). In L dimensions, the NFFT requires O(N(-ln epsilon)(L) +
   (IIl=1L Me) Sigma(l=1)(L) logM(l)) operations, where M-l is the number
   of Fourier components along dimension l, N is the number of irregularly
   spaced samples, and epsilon is the required accuracy. This is a
   dramatic improvement over the O (N IIl=1L M-l) operations required for
   the direct evaluation (NDFT).
   The performance of the NFFT depends on the lowpass filter used in the
   algorithm. A truncated Gauss pulse, proposed in the literature, is
   optimized. A newly proposed filter, a Gauss pulse tapered with a
   Hanning window, performs better than the truncated Gauss pulse and the
   B-spline, also proposed in the literature. For small filter length, a
   numerically optimized filter shows the best results. Numerical
   experiments for 1-D and 2-D implementations confirm the theoretically
   predicted accuracy and efficiency properties of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, the data consist of ( or may be naturally
   formulated as) an m x n matrix A which may be stored on disk but which
   is too large to be read into random access memory ( RAM) or to
   practically perform superlinear polynomial time computations on it. Two
   algorithms are presented which, when given an m x n matrix A, compute
   approximations to A which are the product of three smaller matrices, C,
   U, and R, each of which may be computed rapidly. Let A' = CUR be the
   computed approximate decomposition; both algorithms have provable
   bounds for the error matrix A - A'. In the first algorithm, c columns
   of A and r rows of A are randomly chosen. If the m x c matrix C
   consists of those c columns of A ( after appropriate rescaling) and the
   r x n matrix R consists of those r rows of A ( also after appropriate
   rescaling), then the c x r matrix U may be calculated from C and R. For
   any matrix X, let parallel to X parallel to(F) and parallel to X
   parallel to(2) denote its Frobenius norm and its spectral norm,
   respectively. It is proven that
   parallel to A - A'parallel to(xi) <= min (D: rank( D) <= k) parallel to
   A - D parallel to(xi) + poly(k, 1/c)parallel to A parallel to(F)
   holds in expectation and with high probability for both xi = 2, F and
   for all k = 1,..., rank(A); thus by appropriate choice of k
   parallel to A - A'parallel to(2) <=epsilon parallel to A parallel to(F)
   also holds in expectation and with high probability. This algorithm may
   be implemented without storing the matrix A in RAM, provided it can
   make two passes over the matrix stored in external memory and use O( m
   + n) additional RAM ( assuming that c and r are constants, independent
   of the size of the input). The second algorithm is similar except that
   it approximates the matrix C by randomly sampling a constant number of
   rows of C. Thus, it has additional error but it can be implemented in
   three passes over the matrix using only constant additional RAM. To
   achieve an additional error ( beyond the best rank-k approximation)
   that is at most epsilon parallel to A parallel to(F), both algorithms
   take time which is a low-degree polynomial in k, 1/epsilon, and
   1/delta, where delta > 0 is a failure probability; the. rst takes time
   linear in max(m, n) and the second takes time independent of m and n.
   The proofs for the error bounds make important use of matrix
   perturbation theory and previous work on approximating matrix
   multiplication and computing low-rank approximations to a matrix. The
   probability distribution over columns and rows and the rescaling are
   crucial features of the algorithms and must be chosen judiciously.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, the data consist of ( or may be naturally

   than m and n. Methods such as the singular value decomposition (SVD)
   may be used to find an approximation to A which is the best in a
   well-defined sense. These methods require memory and time which are
   superlinear in m and n; for many applications in which the data sets
   are very large this is prohibitive. Two simple and intuitive algorithms
   are presented which, when given an m x n matrix A, compute a

Abstract = {{This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from
   incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f is an
   element of C-N and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Q. Is it
   possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier
   coefficients on the set Q? A typical result of this paper is as follows.
   Suppose that f is a superposition of vertical bar T vertical bar spikes
   f(t) = E-tau is an element of T f(tau)delta(t - tau) obeying
   vertical bar T vertical bar <= C-M (.) (logN)(-1 .) vertical bar ohm
   vertical bar
   for some constant C-M > 0. We do not know the locations of the spikes
   nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1 - O(N-m), f can
   be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the l(1) minimization
   problem
   min/g Sigma(N-1)/t=0 vertical bar g(t)vertical bar, s.t. (g) over
   cap(omega) = (f) over cap(omega) for al omega is an element of ohm
   In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex
   optimization problem. We give numerical values for Cm which depend on
   the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a
   novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any
   signal made out of vertical bar T vertical bar spikes may be recovered
   by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size
   O(vertical bar T vertical bar (.) log N). Moreover, this is nearly
   optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1 -
   O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least
   proportional to vertical bar T vertical bar (.) log N.
   The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher
   dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise
   constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency
   samples-provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the
   condition above-by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total

Abstract = {{Suppose we are given a vector f in a class F subset of R-N e.g., a class
   of digital signals or digital images. How many linear measurements do we
   need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision is an
   element of in the Euclidean (l(2)) metric? This paper shows that if the
   objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it
   is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small
   number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More
   precisely, suppose that the,nth largest entry of the vector If I (or of
   its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys vertical bar f vertical
   bar((n)) < R (.) n(-1/P), where R > 0 and p > 0. Suppose that we take
   measurements y(k) = < f, X-k >; k = 1..., K, where the X-k are
   N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries.
   Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0 < p < 1 and
   with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction f(\#) defined as the
   solution to the constraints y(k) = < f(\#), X-k > with minimal l(1)
   norm, obeys
   parallel to f - f(\#)parallel to(l2) <= C-p (.) R (.) (K/log N)(-r), r =
   1/p - 1/2
   There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally
   impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements
   whatsoever. The methodology extends to various other random measurement
   ensembles; for example, we show that similar results hold if one
   observes a few randomly sampled Fourier coefficients of f. In fact, the
   results are quite general and require only two hypotheses on the
   measurement ensemble which are detailed.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a randomized procedure that, given an in x it matrix A and
   a positive integer k, approximates A with a matrix Z of rank k. The
   algorithm relies on applying a structured I x in random matrix R to
   each column of A, where I is an integer near to, but greater than. k.
   The structure of R allows us to apply it to an arbitrary m x I vector
   at a cost proportional to In log(l); the resulting procedure can
   construct a rank-k approximation Z from the entries of A at a cost
   proportional to mn log(k) + l(2)(m + n). We prove several bounds on the
   accuracy of the algorithm; one such bound guarantees that the spectral
   norm parallel to A - Z parallel to of the discrepancy between A and Z
   is of the same order as root max\{m, n\} times the (k + I)st greatest
   singular value sigma(k+I) of A, with small probability of large
   deviations.
   In contrast, the classical pivoted ``QR{''} decomposition algorithms
   (such as Gram-Schmidt or Householder) require at least kmn
   floating-point operations in order to compute a similarly accurate
   rank-k approximation. In practice, the algorithm of this paper runs
   faster than the classical algorithms, even when k is quite small or
   large. Furthermore, the algorithm operates reliably independently of
   the structure of the matrix A, can access each column of A
   independently and at most twice, and parallelizes naturally. Thus, the
   algorithm provides an efficient, reliable means for computing several
   of the greatest singular values and corresponding singular vectors of
   A. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{Each discrete cosine transform (DCT) uses N real basis vectors whose
   components are cosines. In the DCT-4, for example, the jth component of
   v(k) is cos(j + 1/2) (k + 1/2)pi/n. These basis vectors are orthogonal
   and the transform is extremely useful in image processing. Tf the
   vector x gives the intensities along a row of pixels, its cosine series
   Sigma c(k)v(k) has the coefficients c(k) = (x,v(k))/N. They are quickly
   computed from a Fast Fourier Transform. But a direct proof of
   orthogonality, by calculating inner products, does not reveal how
   natural these cosine vectors are.
   We prove orthogonality in a different way. Each DCT basis contains the
   eigenvectors of a symmetric ``second difference{''}: matrix. By varying
   the boundary conditions we get the established transforms DCT-1 through
   DCT-4. Other combinations lead to four additional cosine transforms.
   The type of boundary condition (Dirichlet or Neumann, centered at a
   meshpoint or a midpoint) determines the applications that are
   appropriate for each transform. The centering also determines the
   period: N - 1 or N in the established transforms, N - 1/2 or N + 1/2 in
   the other four. The key point is that all these ``eigenvectors of
   cosines{''} come from simple and familiar matrices.}},

Abstract = {{A new PDE solver was introduced recently, in Part I of this two-paper
   sequence, on the basis of two main concepts: the well-known Alternating
   Direction Implicit (ADI) approach, on one hand, and a certain ``Fourier
   Continuation{''} (FC) method for the resolution of the Gibbs
   phenomenon, on the other. Unlike previous alternating direction methods
   of order higher than one, which only deliver unconditional stability
   for rectangular domains, the new high-order FC-AD (Fourier-Continuation
   Alternating-Direction) algorithm yields unconditional stability for
   general domains at an O(N log(N)) cost per time-step for an N point
   spatial discretization grid. In the present contribution we provide an
   overall theoretical discussion of the FC-AD approach and we extend the
   FC-AD methodology to linear hyperbolic PDEs. In particular, we study
   the convergence properties of the newly introduced FC(Gram) Fourier
   Continuation method for both approximation of general functions and
   solution of the alternating-direction ODEs. We also present (for
   parabolic PDEs on general domains, and, thus, for our associated
   elliptic solvers) a stability criterion which, when satisfied, ensures
   unconditional stability of the FC-AD algorithm. Use of this criterion
   in conjunction with numerical evaluation of a series of singular values
   (of the alternating-direction discrete one-dimensional operators)
   suggests clearly that the fifth-order accurate class of parabolic and
   elliptic FC-AD solvers we propose is indeed unconditionally stable for
   all smooth spatial domains and for arbitrarily fine discretizations. To
   illustrate the FC-AD methodology in the hyperbolic PDE context,
   finally, we present an example concerning the Wave Equation
   demonstrating sixth-order spatial and fourth-order temporal accuracy,
   as well as a complete absence of the debilitating ``dispersion
   error{''}, also known as ``pollution error{''}, that arises as
   finite-difference and finite-element solvers are applied to solution of
   wave propagation problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new methodology for the numerical solution of Partial
   Differential Equations in general spatial domains: our algorithms are
   based on the use of the well-known Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)
   approach in conjunction with a certain ``Fourier continuation{''} (FC)
   method for the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Unlike previous
   alternating direction methods of order higher than one, which can only

   high-order algorithms possess the desirable property of unconditional
   stability for general domains; the computational time required by our
   algorithms to advance a solution by one time-step, in turn, grows in an
   essentially linear manner with the number of spatial discretization
   points used. In this paper we demonstrate the FC-AD methodology through
   a variety of examples concerning the Heat and Laplace Equations in two
   and three-dimensional domains with smooth boundaries. Applications of
   the FC-AD methodology to Hyperbolic PDEs together with a theoretical
   discussion of the method will be put forth in a subsequent

   the unconditional stability and high-order convergence of the proposed

Abstract = {{Arecibo delay-Doppler measurements of (99942) Apophis in 2005 and 2006
   resulted in a five standard-deviation trajectory correction to the
   optically predicted close approach distance to Earth in 2029. The radar
   measurements reduced the volume of the statistical uncertainty region
   entering the encounter to 7.3\% of the pre-radar solution, but increased
   the trajectory uncertainty growth rate across the encounter by 800\% due
   to the closer predicted approach to the Earth. A small estimated Earth
   impact probability remained for 2036. With standard-deviation
   plane-of-sky position uncertainties for 2007-2010 already less than 0.2
   arcsec, the best near-term ground-based optical astrometry can only
   weakly affect the trajectory estimate. While the potential for impact in
   2036 will likely be excluded in 2013 (if not 2011) using ground-based
   optical measurements, approximations within the Standard Dynamical Model
   (SDM) used to estimate and predict the trajectory from the current era
   are sufficient to obscure the difference between a predicted impact and
   a miss in 2036 by altering the dynamics leading into the 2029 encounter.
   Normal impact probability assessments based on the SDM become
   problematic without knowledge of the object's physical properties;
   impact could be excluded while the actual dynamics still permit it.
   Calibrated position uncertainty intervals are developed to compensate
   for this by characterizing the minimum and maximum effect of physical
   parameters on the trajectory. Uncertainty in accelerations related to
   solar radiation can cause between 82 and 4720 Earth-radii of trajectory
   change relative to the SDM by 2036. If an actionable hazard exists,
   alteration by 2-10\% of Apophis' total absorption of solar radiation in
   2018 could be sufficient to produce a six standard-deviation trajectory
   change by 2036 given physical characterization; even a 0.5\% change
   could produce a trajectory shift of one Earth-radius by 2036 for all
   possible spin-poles and likely masses. Planetary ephemeris uncertainties
   are the next greatest source of systematic error, causing up to 23
   Earth-radii of uncertainty. The SDM Earth point-mass assumption
   introduces an additional 2.9 Earth-radii of prediction error by 2036.
   Unmodeled asteroid perturbations produce as much as 2.3 Earth-radii of
   error. We find no future small-body encounters likely to yield an
   Apophis mass determination prior to 2029. However, asteroid (144898)
   2004 VD 17, itself having a statistical Earth impact in 2102, will
   probably encounter Apophis at 6.7 lunar distances in 2034, their
   uncertainty regions coming as close as 1.6 lunar distances near the
   center of both SDM probability distributions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We present a new method for construction of high-order parametrizations

   used to produce full surface parametrizations (by sets of local charts,
   each one representing a large surface patch - which, typically,
   contains thousands of the points in the original point-cloud) for
   complex surfaces of scientific and engineering relevance. The proposed
   approach accurately renders both smooth and non-smooth portions of a
   surface: it yields super-algebraically convergent Fourier series
   approximations to a given surface up to and including all points of
   geometric singularity, such as corners, edges, conical points, etc. In
   view of their C-infinity smoothness (except at true geometric
   singularities) and their properties of high-order approximation, the
   surfaces produced by this method are suitable for use in conjunction
   with high-order numerical methods for boundary value problems in
   domains with complex boundaries, including PDE solvers, integral
   equation solvers, etc. Our approach is based on a very simple concept:
   use of Fourier analysis to continue smooth portions of a piecewise
   smooth function into new functions which, defined on larger domains,
   are both smooth and periodic. The ``continuation functions{''} arising
   from a function f converge super-algebraically to f in its domain of

Abstract = {{A method to interpolate a bounded bandlimited signal from its own

   signal processing applications, from which three cases are studied. For
   the Farrow interpolator, it assures that the interpolation error will
   be smaller than a known bound, both in the time and frequency domains.
   For delay estimation, the method allows one to decouple a given
   estimation/detection algorithm in two steps. In the first one, a few
   finite convolutions are carried out in order to compute a set of
   interpolation coefficients. In the second, the algorithm is executed
   but with a complexity independent of the length of the temporal
   observation interval. Besides, it is,shown how to introduce this
   decoupling in the matched filter, MUSIC, and conditional
   maximum-likelihood delay estimators. Finally, the method is employed to
   give a simple solution to an important efficiency problem in the

Abstract = {{We present a Fourier continuation (FC) algorithm for the solution of the
   fully nonlinear compressible Navier-Stokes equations in general spatial
   domains. The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated
   FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as
   the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based
   PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant
   coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes
   a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields
   general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not
   restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to
   general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed
   algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from
   rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence,
   essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder
   CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods
   since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows
   linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We
   demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the
   algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant
   to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a stylized communications problem where one wishes
   to transmit a real-valued signal x is an element of R-n (a block of n
   pieces of information) to a remote receiver. We ask whether it is
   possible to transmit this information reliably when a fraction of the
   transmitted codeword is corrupted by arbitrary gross errors, and when in
   addition, all the entries of the codeword are contaminated by smaller
   errors (e.g., quantization errors).
   We show that if one encodes the information as Ax where A is an element
   of R-m x n (m >= n) is a suitable coding matrix, there are two decoding
   schemes that allow the recovery of the block of n pieces of information
   x with nearly the same accuracy as if no gross errors occurred upon
   transmission (or equivalently as if one had an oracle supplying perfect
   information about the sites and amplitudes of the gross errors).
   Moreover, both decoding strategies are very concrete and only involve
   solving simple convex optimization programs, either a linear program or
   a second-order cone program. We complement our study with numerical
   simulations showing that the encoder/decoder pair performs remarkably
   well.}},

                 solving differential equations by the spectral
                 collocation (i.e., pseudospectral) method is presented.
                 It includes functions for computing derivatives of
                 arbitrary order corresponding to Chebyshev, Hermite,
                 Laguerre, Fourier, and sinc interpolants. Auxiliary
                 functions are included for incorporating boundary
                 conditions, performing interpolation using barycentric
                 formulas, and computing roots of orthogonal
                 polynomials. It is demonstrated how to use the package
                 for solving eigenvalue, boundary value, and initial
                 value problems arising in the fields of special
                 functions, quantum mechanics, nonlinear waves, and
